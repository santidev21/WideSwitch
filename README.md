# WideSwitch

WideSwitch is a small utility that allows you to instantly toggle between two display resolutions using `nircmd.exe`.

This is useful for ultrawide monitor users who want to quickly switch between a full native resolution for productivity and a scaled resolution for better performance and compatibility in games.

### How it works
The app detects the current screen width and executes one of two predefined display mode commands.  
No UI, no config — just one click switch.

### Requirements
- Windows 10 or newer
- `nircmd.exe` placed at: `C:\Tools\nircmd\nircmd.exe`

### Example Resolutions (default)
- **3440x1440 @ 60Hz**
- **2560x1440 @ 120Hz**

You can modify the values directly in the source code.

### Build & Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio
3. Build in Release mode
4. Run the executable
